                When you are playing online games, you may receive some malicious chat content sent to you by other players, such as malicious alerts that you just encountered while playing the game (making you think that your account is really locked and can only be unlocked by clicking on the link you received), you need to be alert when you encounter scenarios with URLs in the chat content, because it is likely that you are suffering from cyber hacking, do not click on the links unless you trust the person sending the messages very much
